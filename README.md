# half-life_and_opposing-force_hd
 
These files are not my own, I have compiled them from several sources and put them together into one pack. As more are released or new updates come along I will add them to this pack. This really changes the original Half-Life and gives an impressive feel and look to the game but yet keeping that classic half-life engine. Please bear in mind that maps that use custom wad files will not have these HD textures as they use their own. I do not have a HD opfor.wad as of yet but hopefully soon.

This is not a new mod for half-life it simply replacing/updating the old WAD/Texture file and weapon models to give it a more up-to-date look. You will need to have a copy of half-life or opposing force in order to use these files.


How to install.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you start, it is a good idea to back up your original valve_hd folder and gearbox_hd folder (just rename the previous one to somethign else). There already is a back up copy of the halflife.wad in case you do not like the new HD wad.

Copy these files into your Half-Life folder.

You will need to enable the following in console or add it to your userconfig.cfg

r_detailtextures "1"

r_detailtexturessupported "1"


Bugs/Errors that I found so far
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The v_357 and the v_hornetgun weapon models seem to make my Opposing Force game crash, there is no issue using these in normal Half-Life. Not sure why as it doesn't give me an error. I tested it on Linux and it had no issues, could be something with Windows or maybe just my own PC, so perhaps just something to mindful of if your game won't load.
